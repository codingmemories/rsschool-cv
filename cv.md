## Summary

* My priority as a front-end developer is to create user experiences that meet business goals while exceeding user expectations.
* I excel at creating responsive websites that are both functional and user-friendly. I've also worked with React and Angular, 
  and I'm always eager to learn new technologies.
* I've worked on several projects in the last year, one of them is a responsive e-commerce website. These projects have given me 
  the opportunity to hone my front-end skills and improve my ability to work collaboratively with a team.
* I am a technology enthusiast who is constantly striving to improve my skills through online courses and personal projects. I am thrilled to be working 
  in a fast-paced, dynamic environment where I will be able to continue to learn and grow as a front-end developer.
